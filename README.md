# How to use

- Install [`evaluate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/index) library

```shell
pip install evaluate
```

- Load the layout metric and then compute the score

```python
import evaluate
import numpy as np

# Load the evaluation metric named "shunk031/layout_alignment"
alignment_score = evaluate.load("shunk031/layout_alignment")

# `batch_bbox` is a tensor representing (batch_size, max_num_elements, coordinates) 
# and `batch_mask` is a tensor representing (batch_size, max_num_elements).
batch_bbox = np.random.rand(512, 25, 4)
batch_mask = np.random.rand(512, 25)

# Add the batch of bboxes and masks to the metric
alignment_score.add_batch(batch_bbox=batch_bbox, batch_mask=batch_mask)
# Perform the computation of the evaluation metric
alignment_score.compute()
```
